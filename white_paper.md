## Blockchain service for the Cosmos Network and all Cosmos Ecosystem

Cosmos Ecosystem became bigger and bigger, and problems, that was small at past, grew up with Ecosystem.

All projects in Cosmos Ecosystem have 3 kinds of problems.

### Economical problems:

1) General dependence of existing projects of the Cosmos Ecosystem on centralized exchanges

2) Irrational idleness of community pool funds of Cosmos Network and all other projects from Cosmos Ecosystem

### Security problems:

1) The threat of centralization of the Cosmos Network due to the concentration of Voting Power in the hands of just a few validators

2) Not rational competition between validators for delegates, that What makes Validators spend resources on marketing to attract delegates. It distracts from the main task: maintain network security, try to achieve maximum uptime, and upgrading the infrastructurethe. Also this competition for delegators undermines the spirit of decentralization and Win-Win

3) The "21-day unbonding period" discourages ordinary users from becoming delegators and improve network security

### Social problems:

1) Validators have the ability to make decisions in the interests of validators, but not in the interests of the community and users

2) Delegators don't take part in governance due to lack of motivation in decision making. They are only interested in receiving rewards.

3) Validators use the Voting Power of Delegators, who are not voting for proposal

4) Active community members, who want to governance the network can't do this due to the low Voting Power

5) A large number of ordinary users consider the Network exclusively from an economic point of view, and don't see social aspect of the Network

### We've found solutions for all this problems!

1) Make a modernization of Governance Module
2) Creating "Proof-of-Time Module"
3) Ð¡ombining Fundraising Module with Liquidity Pool

### That's what we'll get

- With every exchange, users will support Cosmos Network (improve the Cosmos Network security, and create economical motivation for community to governance the Network).
- Liquidity providers will get benefits from each exchange.
- Liquidity providing will improve the Cosmos Network Security.
- Community Pools of all Cosmos Ecosystem projects will be motivated by growing of their pools and rational using of funds, to become liquidity providers. (And it will improve the Cosmos Network security by projects from Cosmos Ecosystem) 
- Users, who are interesting only in economical part of the Cosmos Network, will  become delegators, but they will delegate not to Validators, but to Liquidity Pool. They will earn with improving the Cosmos Network security. 
- Validators will concentrate on the uptime, attracting new users, and modernization of infrastructure. (Creating "Proof-of-Time Module" that can be used by all Ecosystem after)
- Community will be motivated to actively participate in governance of the Cosmos Network and attracting new users, in the interests of ordinary users, liquidity providers and validators.
